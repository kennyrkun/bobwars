# bobwars
bobwars is a simple RTS game designed to expand Age of Empires to allow for much deeper strategies.
it's also based off of the "This is Bob" copy/pasta from when Google+ took over. Guess what the two civs are?

## Setting up
Clone the project to the desired location on your machine.
Make sure you have [SFML 2.4](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.4.2/) in the project's root directory.

## Playing
While in the game, the WASD are used to control the main view, and the arrow keys are used to move selected units. You can create or destroy a unit using one of the two buttons located in the top left corner of the map. To select a unit, simply left click the desired unit. To deselect that unit, either click another unit or click something that is not a unit. 

The speed of the camera can be changed by holding down the Left-Shift Key.
