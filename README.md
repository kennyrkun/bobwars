# bobwars
bobwars is a simple RTS game for getting a developer's hands dirty. After this, off to clone Age of Empires!
It's also based off of the "This is Bob" copy/pasta from when Google+ took over. Guess what the two civs are?

## Setting up
Clone the project to the desired location on your machine.
Make sure you have [SFML 2.4](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.4.2/) in the project's root directory.

If you want to build the game without dynamic runtime library linking then you'll have to [build SFML yourself](http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=8158.msg54553#msg54553).

## Playing
While in the game, the WASD are used to control the main view, and the arrow keys are used to move selected units. You can create or destroy a unit using one of the two buttons located in the top left corner of the map. To select a unit, simply left click the desired unit. To deselect that unit, either click another unit or click something that is not a unit. 

The speed of the camera can be changed by holding down the Left-Shift Key.
