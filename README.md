# bobwars
bobwars is a game like age of empires (2), except instead of being all medieval and stuff it's just the bob copy pasta and google plus

## Setting up
Clone the project to the desired location on your machine.
Make sure you have [SFML 2.4](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.4.2/) in the project's root directory.

If you want to build the game without dynamic runtime library linking then you'll have to [build SFML yourself](http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=8158.msg54553#msg54553).

## Playing
While in the game, the WASD are used to control the main view, and the arrow keys are used to move selected units. Units can be created with the create button, and delete with the delete button or the DEL key. To select a unit, simply left click the desired unit. To deselect that unit, either click another unit or click something that is not a unit.
